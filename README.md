# The Elaphodus project

A universal code documentation transpiler to markdown.

## About the current branch

This branch is created, so we can quickly create a prototype and map out the features that we want in python.
This branch is not meant to be used in production.

This branch also does not contain any tests as this is just for markup and thinking out how the application should 
behave.
